# Search feature in react

____

Search feature is one of the most important utility in every application
it enables any user to find data or files that they are looking for by
just typing letters or string with the same format to that certain files or data.

In this project I have created a very basic search feature in react that filters through
names of celebrities and will display some data about their networth and other personal data.

I use [Ninjas API](https://api-ninjas.com/) for this project.
